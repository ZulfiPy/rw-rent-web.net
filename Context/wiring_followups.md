# Frontend Wiring — what remains

> **The single document of the frontend wiring phase.** The phase is implemented and verified
> (commits `2a2cece` … `53df077` on `feature/backend-wiring`, 2026-09-15/16): the app runs on the
> real API, the mock is gone, every screen reads the projections the backend serves, the account area
> is a port of the prototype (`Context/prototype/RW-Rent.dc.html`, the design source, stays in this
> folder), and the three follow-ups are in. The phase's specification, plan, follow-up ledger and
> reports were removed as implemented; git history keeps them. What is still to do is below.
>
> Working folders: this app in `/Users/zulf/rw-rent-api/rw-rent-web-wiring` (branch
> `feature/backend-wiring`); the backend in `/Users/zulf/rw-rent-api/RWRentApi-wiring` (same branch
> name). The main checkouts stay untouched until the merge gate (§3) opens. Rewritten 2026-09-16.

## 1. The owner's manual check (the gate before the merge)

Deferred by the owner on 2026-09-16. Decided the same day: the app ships without Tasks and Insurance
cases for now (their brainstorm is parked), and an **independent testing phase** runs first, by a
separate agent in a fresh session, against both the API and the app as they are: brief in
`Context/testing_brief.md`, report in `Context/testing_report.md`. Its findings become the next
follow-ups on the side they name. After that, and after the seed data is replaced with real data,
the owner works through the tables of §2 on their devices, with the accounts listed there (or the real
ones by then), the app at `http://localhost:5173`, the API at `http://localhost:5001`, emails at
`http://localhost:8025`, the seed password kept outside the repository. Differences from the
prototype found there become the next follow-up.

## 2. Verification tables and accounts

### 2.1 Account screens — prototype screen → app route → what to compare

| Prototype screen | App route | What to compare |
|---|---|---|
| `signin` | `/sign-in` | title, the two fields, "Forgot password?" on the password's label row, the black Sign in with its arrow, "No account yet? Create one", the footer line, the art panel |
| `register` | `/register` | the two names on one row, the phone placeholder, the four-rule checklist filling in as you type (four rules by the owner's decision; the prototype still shows five) |
| `register-submitted` | `/register` after Create account | the mail glyph, both facts, the two actions |
| `confirm-checking` · `confirm-done` · `confirm-bad` | `/confirm-registration-email` | the glyph and its colour, the fact list, the mono `code:` line |
| `resend` | `/confirm-registration-email?resend=1` | title and body; the app adds the password field the API requires (backlog item 1) |
| `pending` | `/sign-in` as a confirmed but unactivated account | five facts, the warn hourglass |
| `rejected` · `expired` · `suspended` | `/sign-in` as each account | glyph, colour, actions |
| `session-expired` | `/sign-in` after a session is revoked elsewhere | the warn clock, "Sign in again", and that it returns to the page you were on |
| `rate-limited` | `/sign-in` after repeated attempts | the `HTTP 429` mono line |
| `forgot` · `forgot-sent` | `/reset-password` | the email field with its note, "Send reset link", then the outgoing-mail screen |
| `reset` · `reset-bad` | `/reset-password` from the emailed link | the token note with its key glyph, the checklist, then the unusable screen with the API's code |
| `transfer-accept` | `/accept-administrator-transfer` | title, body, the existing-password field and its note (backlog item 1 for the two fields the API does not take) |
| `profile` · Profile | `/profile` | the two panels, "Update phone", "Show permissions" |
| `profile` · Sign-in & security | `/profile?tab=security` | both panels, their notes, the dialogs behind Change password and Change email |
| `profile` · Your sessions | `/profile?tab=sessions` | the six columns, the Current chip and "This device", "Revoke other sessions" |
| `noaccess` | any route as an account with no permissions | the info banner, both panels, the empty navigation |

### 2.2 Every other screen — compare with the mock's rendering, and what to try

| Screen | Compare with the mock's rendering | Try |
|---|---|---|
| Overview | metric cards, Needs attention, assignment mix, activity card | the counts: 4 active of 12, 2 planned, 2 vehicles available of 8 active, 3 registrations |
| Needs attention | the same five rows in the same order | open each row; the two interruptions and the planned handover without a driver |
| Rental assignments | coverage column, Interrupted chip, model and type sub-lines | filter by status; filter by a planned or started date range; open 552 KLM (collective coverage, one open interruption) |
| Assignment record | Parties, Lifecycle, Notes, the two tabs, Corrections | cancel a Planned assignment with a note; then read Notes and Corrections |
| Assignment record, Active | the mistaken-activation cancel | cancel without a note: the message appears under the note field, not above the form |
| Vehicles | availability chips and their sub-lines | in use 482 TKL, 770 HDV, 552 KLM, 204 JLM; reserved 444 WKS and 335 SNB; retired 881 GRT, 660 BYH |
| Vehicle record | the same chip as the list, rental history | open 444 WKS from the list |
| Drivers | personal identifier, licence, address columns | search; open Janis Krumins |
| Driver record | the authorization history table | vehicle, customer and status come from the row; the audit panel shows the creation |
| Customers, Customer record | unchanged | open a business and a private customer |
| User directory, User record | Registered column, roles, sessions | open Dita Smite (four role rows) and Imants Gailis (the rejection reason); grant a role with an expiry date and revoke it |
| Registrations | All lifecycle states in one page | the five people; then each single-status filter; activate Gatis Lapsa with a role |
| Security audit | list filters, entity chips | filter by event type and by entity type; open any row |
| Audit entry | the payload diff | open the Registration · Activated entry: the role grant reads "Viewer — no expiry" |
| System Administrator | transfers table | the one open transfer to Liga Brice, Awaiting acceptance; Resend asks for your password |

### 2.3 Seeded accounts (same password for all, set by the owner when seeding)

| Role | Email | Name | What they see |
|---|---|---|---|
| System Administrator | `sysadmin@rwrent.example` | Arturs Veidenbaums | everything, including Corrections and the System Administrator page |
| Company Principal | `signe.priede@rwrent.example` | Signe Priede | the company's records, role administration, the company's audit history |
| Fleet Manager | `karlis.zvaigzne@rwrent.example` | Karlis Zvaigzne | fleet and rental work, registrations to review |
| Viewer | `toms.rudzitis@rwrent.example` | Toms Rudzitis | read-only across the fleet |
| Viewer + Fleet Manager | `dita.smite@rwrent.example` | Dita Smite | four role rows in her record, one of them expiring |
| Suspended | `raivis.dumins@rwrent.example` | Raivis Dumins | cannot sign in; the Account suspended screen says why |

## 3. Merge gate

Both `feature/backend-wiring` branches merge into their `main` only after the owner's manual check
(§1) passes with the wired backend and the wired app running together. Until then the main
checkouts stay untouched, both branches keep receiving the next phases' commits, and the developer
database keeps the seeded dataset.

## 4. Backlog — known, not scheduled

1. The prototype file is out of date in two places (decisions 5 and 6): its transfer-acceptance
   screen shows an email and a new-password field the API does not take, and its resend screen lacks
   the password field the API requires. The app is right; the prototype is the reference for looks
   only. Correct the file if it is ever edited again.
2. The Button `block` variant with the primary tone has poor contrast in the light theme; phone-sized
   dialog sheets use it. Check on the phone in the light theme during §4; fix as a shared-component
   change if confirmed.
3. `GET /api/me` is cached for a minute after a full page load: a role granted or revoked while
   someone is signed in reaches them at the next reload or after that minute.
4. The build is a single chunk over the bundler's size warning (about 560 kB); code splitting is a
   hosting-time decision.
5. The shell's open-work queue runs three list requests on every page; cheap on the seeded data,
   the first thing to look at if a page ever feels slow.
6. Tasks and Insurance cases are sample-data placeholders (`src/pages/overview/sample.ts`,
   `src/pages/simple/`). The owner parked their design on 2026-09-16 (facts gathered: the prototype
   defined only a queue stub for each; the backend has nothing; the vehicle carries no policy,
   road-tax or inspection dates). The app ships without them until that phase is opened.
